# For Complete Beginners — Click-by-Click Setup

This guide is for people who have heard of **CI/CD, SSH, or GitHub Actions** but have never set them up.

- You do not need to “learn the theory” first.
- Do not open or edit YML files.
- Follow the numbered steps in order.
- When something fails, read the red error text — it usually names what you forgot.

## What does this system do? (30 seconds)

The goal is: **ship a new version to live.** People using the site / app pick up the update as they browse or refresh (e.g. F5). There is no “announce downtime and make everyone manually close / reset the app” ritual.

In short:

1. When code is pushed to GitHub it is **built and tested automatically**.
2. An authorized person **approves** going live.
3. After approval the new version is **written to the idle channel** on the server; once health passes, nginx **silently** routes traffic to it — users notice nothing; their next request gets the updated version. This is called “blue-green” deployment.
4. For database-backed projects, **EF Core migration** runs automatically before deploy (`EF_PROJECT` variable).
5. If the new version fails the health check, the switch is **never made** — live users keep seeing the previous version without any interruption.

Your job: fill in the settings once. After that: write code → get approval → live updates.

> Technical note (for the curious): The server runs two channels (blue/green); one is always live. The new version is deployed to the idle channel and verified healthy before nginx routes traffic to it. The old channel stays up as an instant rollback target.

## Two paths — pick one

| Option | Meaning | Who |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Same machine** | The machine that runs jobs is also the server | Self-hosted runner setups |
| **B — Remote server** | The app lives on a separate Linux server | Most companies / live trials — **this guide is B** |

For A, see the “Local” section in [`company-setup.en.md`](./company-setup.en.md). Below is **B (remote)** only.

---

## What you need before starting

- [ ] A **GitHub account**
- [ ] Permission to copy the template into your account
- [ ] A **Linux server** (IP/hostname, reachable over SSH)
- [ ] **Admin (root/sudo)** access on that server
- [ ] A terminal on your PC (Windows: PowerShell or WSL; Mac/Linux: Terminal)
- [ ] Your .NET application code (or a sample app)

Words you will see:

| Word | Plain meaning |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | Your project folder on GitHub |
| **Variable** | A setting visible to repo maintainers |
| **Secret** | A hidden setting (keys/passwords); not shown in logs |
| **Environment** | The “ask for approval before production” box |
| **Runner** | The computer GitHub uses to run commands for you |
| **SSH** | Remote login with a key (no password each time) |
| **Deploy** | Going live / publishing the new version to users |

---

## Section 0 — Create a key (on your computer)

This key lets GitHub prove to the server “I am allowed.” No password prompt per deploy.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Paste and press Enter:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy" -N "" -f deploy_key
```

3. Two files appear in that folder:
   - `deploy_key` → **secret**. You will paste it into a GitHub Secret.
   - `deploy_key.pub` → **public**. You will put it on the server.

4. View the private key:

```bash
# Linux / Mac / WSL
cat deploy_key

# Windows PowerShell
Get-Content deploy_key
```

You should see text starting with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`. Keep it temporarily (Notepad). Delete from Notepad when finished.

---

## Section 1 — Create the GitHub project

1. Open https://github.com/Dedmoo/dotnet-cicd-template  
2. Green **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**  
3. Name it (e.g. `mycompany-app`) → **Create**  
4. After it opens, move everything inside `templates/` to the **repo root**:
   - `.github` must be at the root  
   - `scripts` must be at the root  
5. Put your .NET code in the same repo root (`src/...`).  
6. Push to the `main` branch.

Check: Can you see `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml` at the repo root? Yes → continue.

---

## Section 2 — Prepare the server (Linux, once)

SSH in as admin (replace with your IP):

```bash
ssh root@SERVER_IP
```

or with your sudo-capable user.

### 2.1 Create the user

```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" deploy
sudo mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
```

### 2.2 Put the public key on the server

On your PC, copy `deploy_key.pub`:

```bash
cat deploy_key.pub
```

On the server (replace `PASTE` with that one line):

```bash
echo "PASTE" | sudo tee /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
```

### 2.3 Passwordless admin rights (critical)

Without this, live deploy will go **red**:

```bash
echo 'deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/deploy
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/deploy
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/deploy
sudo -u deploy sudo -n true && echo "sudo OK"
```

You must see `sudo OK`. If not, stop — do not continue.

### 2.4 Required packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y rsync curl nginx
```

Also install the **.NET** version your app needs (whatever your company uses — e.g. .NET 8).

### 2.5 Capture host identity (`SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`)

**On your PC** (after leaving the server session):

```bash
ssh-keyscan -p 22 SERVER_IP
```

Copy **all** output lines. You will paste them into a GitHub Variable next.

---

## Section 3 — GitHub settings (click by click)

In the repo: top menu **Settings**.

### 3.1 Variables

Path: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** → **New repository variable**

Add these **one by one**:

| Name | Value — replace with your real data |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_TARGET` | `remote` |
| `SSH_HOST` | Server IP or domain (e.g. `203.0.113.10`) |
| `SSH_USER` | `deploy` |
| `SSH_PORT` | `22` (or your SSH port) |
| `RUNNER_LABEL` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` | Full `ssh-keyscan` output from Section 2.5 |
| `SERVICES` | Adapt the one-liner below to your paths |
| `EF_PROJECT` | Project with migrations, e.g. `src/Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj` |
| `EF_STARTUP_PROJECT` | (Optional) startup project; if empty, first `SERVICES` csproj is used |

Example `SERVICES` (one app):

```
web|src/Web/Web.csproj|/opt/myapp-web|myapp-web|http://SERVER_IP:5001
```

Meaning (you do not need to memorize this):

- `web` = short name  
- `src/Web/Web.csproj` = project file to build (use your real path)  
- `/opt/myapp-web` = folder on the server  
- `myapp-web` = service name  
- `http://SERVER_IP:5001` = nginx's public port (you may add a health path, e.g. `http://SERVER_IP:5001/health`)  

> The pipeline checks health via **socket** and ignores the IP. What matters is the port (nginx) and path (health endpoint).

For multiple services: press Enter in the Variable box for another line.

### 3.2 Secrets

Path: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets** → **New repository secret**

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | The **entire** text of `deploy_key` from Section 0 (`BEGIN` … `END` included) |

For database-backed projects (required):

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | Connection string, e.g. `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=DB_IP,1433;User Id=...;Password=...;TrustServerCertificate=true` |

You can add other secret settings (API keys, etc.) as additional lines in the same secret.

### 3.3 Production approval box

Path: **Settings → Environments → New environment**

1. Name it **exactly**: `production`  
2. **Configure environment**  
3. **Required reviewers** → pick at least one person  
4. Enable **Prevent self-review** if available  
5. Deployment branches → **Selected branches** → only `main`  
6. Save  

Without this, Production Deploy may behave unexpectedly around approvals.

---

## Section 4 — One-time host setup script

On your PC, from the repo root where `scripts/` exists (and `deploy_key` is nearby):

```bash
SSH_HOST=SERVER_IP \
SSH_USER=deploy \
SSH_PORT=22 \
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat deploy_key)" \
SERVICES="web|src/Web/Web.csproj|/opt/myapp-web|myapp-web|http://SERVER_IP:5001" \
bash scripts/setup-remote-host.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell without `bash`, use WSL or Git Bash.

If it finishes with no error, nginx is configured and systemd units are on the server. The app folder may still be empty until the first deploy.

---

## Section 5 — First automatic build (CI)

1. Push any small change to `main` (or wait if you already pushed).  
2. Open the repo → **Actions**.  
3. Wait for **Continuous Integration** to show a green check.

If red: open the failed step and read the log (often a wrong `SERVICES` path or missing .NET).

---

## Section 6 — Go live (Deploy)

1. **Actions** → left sidebar **Production Deploy**  
2. **Run workflow**  
3. Type a description (required), e.g. `first live trial`  
4. Source: leave **`ci_artifact`** (if there is no artifact yet, pick `build_from_source` once)  
5. **Run workflow**  

Then:

1. The run opens → **prepare** turns green first (writes a summary).  
2. The reviewer checks Summary / the approval screen → **Approve**.  
3. Deploy finishes → on failure the nginx switch was not made; live was unaffected. Fix and retrigger.

During deploy (after approval): database migration runs first, then the new version is published to the idle color.

Success: your app answers at the `health_url`.

---

## If something breaks (short dictionary)

| What you see | Likely missing piece |
|---|---|
| `Permission denied (publickey)` | `.pub` not on server or wrong user |
| `sudo: a password is required` | Section 2.3 sudoers not done |
| `Host key verification failed` | Empty/wrong `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` |
| `invalid format` / libcrypto | Incomplete key pasted into the Secret |
| Health fail but SSH works | nginx not installed or `setup-remote-host.sh` not run |
| Artifact not found | CI must be green first — or use `build_from_source` once |
| Migration error | Is `EF_PROJECT` path correct? Is connection string in `APP_ENV`? Can the runner reach the DB? |

Longer table: [`README.md`](../README.md) troubleshooting section.

## Done checklist

- [ ] `deploy_key` / `.pub` created  
- [ ] Server has `deploy` + authorized_keys  
- [ ] Saw `sudo OK`  
- [ ] GitHub Variables set (`DEPLOY_TARGET`, `SSH_*`, `RUNNER_LABEL`, `SERVICES`, `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, `EF_PROJECT`)
- [ ] Secrets: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` + `APP_ENV` (DB connection string)
- [ ] Environment `production` + reviewer  
- [ ] `setup-remote-host.sh` ran (nginx + systemd units created)  
- [ ] Continuous Integration green  
- [ ] Production Deploy approved and successful  

All checked → **setup is finished**. Daily work: code → push → CI green → Production Deploy → approve.
